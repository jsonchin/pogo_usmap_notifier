# Pokemon Go Facebook Messenger Notifier (scrapes from [USMaps San Jose](https://usmaps.me/livemap.php?c=san-jose))

A notification system for Pokemon Go in the San Jose region.

- Choose which Pokemon spawns to be notified upon
- Define the area to be notified upon (as long as it's within the range of USMaps San Jose)

I run a cronjob every minute to be respectful of the service the usmaps provides while giving me and my friends ample time to react and catch the Pokemon.
