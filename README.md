# Pokemon Go Facebook Messenger Notifier (scrapes from [USMaps San Jose](https://usmaps.me/livemap.php?c=san-jose))

A notification system for Pokemon Go in the San Jose region that uses Facebook Messenger. I like using Messenger with Pokemon Go because it doesn't tab you out of Pokemon Go and keeps track of your distance while you walk. I originally had this notification system with Twitter but I had to go to Chrome/the Twitter app which would tab me out.

- Choose which Pokemon spawns to be notified upon
- Define the area to be notified upon (as long as it's within the range of USMaps San Jose)

I run a cronjob every minute to be respectful of the service the usmaps provides while giving me and my friends ample time to react and catch the Pokemon.
